    <p>My personal favorite beverage is water. I find it to be my preferred choice of drink for a number of reasons. For one, regardless of the lack of taste, water is refreshing, especially when you're either parched (as with most beverages) or done with a laborious and tiring activity. Water is also appropriate for any time of day, whether it be in the morning, afternoon, evening, or even midnight, and, unlike sugary or caffeinated beverages, won't negatively affect one's energy levels when consumed in the later hours of the day. Additionally, water is one of, if not the most accessible liquid or liquids across the planet, and is vital for not just human beings, but for every known species of life on Earth. It is for these reasons that water is my all-time favorite beverage.</p>
